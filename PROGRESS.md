# FPL Vibe Project - Progress Tracker

## 🎯 Project Overview
SwiftUI iOS app backed by Supabase Postgres and FastAPI service for Fantasy Premier League data analysis with filterable tables, tap-to-compare functionality, and fixtures grid.

## ✅ Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Database Foundation ✅
- **Supabase Postgres** database set up with complete schema
- **Core tables**: teams, players, gameweeks, fixtures, player_gw_stats
- **Materialized views** for performance optimization
- **Row Level Security** properly configured
- **Data populated**: 20 teams, 740 players, 38 gameweeks, 380 fixtures, 1,000+ player stats

### Phase 2: Data Synchronization ✅
- **FPL API schema audit** completed (558 fields cataloged)
- **Efficient data sync** using live gameweek endpoints
- **Complete refresh script** (`fpl_refresh_all.py`) working
- **Smart monitoring system** (`fpl_monitor.py`) implemented
- **File-based state tracking** for change detection

### Phase 3: Production Infrastructure ✅
- **Single refresh script** that updates all tables
- **Monitoring service** that checks every hour for changes
- **Change detection** based on finished gameweeks count
- **Clean production directory** (6 essential files)
- **Complete documentation** and deployment guides

```

## 🔄 Data Sync Status
- **Monitoring**: Every hour checks for changes
- **Triggers**: When finished gameweeks count increases
- **Efficiency**: Only refreshes when data actually changes
- **State**: File-based tracking in `monitor_state.json`

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Phase 4: FastAPI Backend (Next Priority)
**Status**: Ready to start
**Goal**: REST API endpoints for iOS app consumption

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Set up FastAPI project structure
- [ ] Create `/players` endpoint with filtering
- [ ] Create `/teams` endpoint with aggregation
- [ ] Create `/fixtures` endpoint for grid data
- [ ] Implement user authentication
- [ ] Add ownership tracking endpoints
- [ ] Set up CORS for iOS app
- [ ] Deploy to DigitalOcean Droplet

### Phase 5: SwiftUI iOS App
**Status**: Pending FastAPI completion
**Goal**: Native iOS app with FPL data visualization

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create SwiftUI project structure
- [ ] Implement Players table with filters
- [ ] Add tap-to-compare functionality
- [ ] Build fixtures grid with horizontal swipe
- [ ] Implement team mode switching
- [ ] Add ownership badges
- [ ] Integrate with FastAPI backend

### Phase 6: Advanced Features
**Status**: Future
**Goal**: Polish and optimization

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Materialized view optimization
- [ ] Performance tuning
- [ ] User analytics
- [ ] Push notifications
- [ ] Advanced filtering options

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Core Tables
- `teams` - Premier League teams (20 records)
- `players` - FPL players (740 records)
- `gameweeks` - FPL gameweeks (38 records)
- `fixtures` - Match fixtures (380 records)
- `player_gw_stats` - Player performance per gameweek (1,000+ records)
- `user_entries` - User FPL team entries
- `user_player_ownership` - Player ownership tracking

### Materialized Views
- `mv_team_gw_fantasy_sums` - Safe team aggregation
- `team_gw_public` - Combined fixture results + fantasy stats
- `mv_team_gw_form` - Rolling 6-gameweek team form
- `mv_player_gw_form` - Rolling 6-gameweek player form

## 🔧 Technical Stack

### Backend
- **Database**: Supabase Postgres
- **API**: FastAPI (to be built)
- **Deployment**: DigitalOcean Droplet
- **Monitoring**: Custom Python script

### Frontend
- **iOS App**: SwiftUI (to be built)
- **Data Source**: FastAPI REST endpoints
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth

### Data Sync
- **Source**: FPL API
- **Method**: Live gameweek endpoints
- **Frequency**: Hourly monitoring with change detection
- **Storage**: File-based state tracking

## 📊 Key Metrics

### Data Volume
- **Teams**: 20 Premier League teams
- **Players**: 740 FPL players
- **Gameweeks**: 38 gameweeks (full season)
- **Fixtures**: 380 fixtures (all past and future)
- **Player Stats**: 1,000+ records (4 completed gameweeks)

### Performance
- **Sync Time**: ~3 minutes for full refresh
- **API Calls**: ~10-15 calls per refresh
- **Monitoring**: ~5 calls per hour check
- **Efficiency**: Only refreshes when changes detected

## 📝 Notes

### Key Decisions Made
1. **File-based state tracking** instead of database for monitoring
2. **Live gameweek endpoints** instead of individual player summaries for efficiency
3. **Upsert operations** instead of clear+insert for data sync
4. **Hourly monitoring** instead of continuous polling
5. **Change detection** instead of scheduled refreshes

### Technical Challenges Solved
1. **RLS policies** for materialized views (not supported in PostgreSQL)
2. **Duplicate key errors** in data sync (solved with upsert approach)
3. **API rate limiting** (implemented proper delays)
4. **Efficient data fetching** (used live endpoints instead of individual calls)

### Next Session Focus
**Start FastAPI backend development** - create REST API endpoints for iOS app consumption.
