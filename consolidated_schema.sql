-- FPL Vibe Database Schema - Complete Consolidated Version
-- Project: fpl-research
-- Created: 2025-01-27
-- Purpose: Single source of truth for the complete FPL Vibe database schema
-- Includes: Core tables, user features, gameweek history, and all necessary functions

-- =============================================
-- TIMEZONE CONFIGURATION
-- =============================================

-- Set timezone for the current session
SET timezone = 'America/Los_Angeles';

-- Set timezone for the database (persistent across all connections)
ALTER DATABASE postgres SET timezone = 'America/Los_Angeles';

-- Set timezone for the current user (persistent for this user)
ALTER USER postgres SET timezone = 'America/Los_Angeles';

-- =============================================
-- EXTENSIONS AND TYPES
-- =============================================

-- Enable necessary extensions
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
